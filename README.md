# Multi layer perceptron (MLP) from scratch and pytorch
Implemented MLP with following details:
- once implement it using PyTorch
- and once from the scratch (only using numpy and matplotlib)

## Steps guide:
- Load the salary dataset using pandas.
- Split the dataset into features and target.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Normalize the data using StandardScaler from sklearn.
- Encode the target variable using LabelEncoder from sklearn.
- Convert the target variable to one-hot encoding.
- Define the neural network model.
- Initialize the model.
- Define the loss function and optimizer.
- Train the model using the training data.
- Evaluate the model on the testing data and print the test accuracy.
